This project is from my internship at The Sparks Foundation. It contains a .twb file that can be opened in Tableau 2020.2 or higher, it also contains the link to the online tableau public where anyone can view the file and the dataset itself. 
Here we perform exploratory analysis to find the issues behind the negative profit ratios for certain sales in a supermarket chain. We then shift to explanatory analysis, thanks to the storytelling features in tableau. We highlight the causes and provide suggestions to out stakeholders and audience to counter the situation. In this projective I've made the right use of pre-attentive attrivutes like colors, labels etc. ato reduce cognitive load on end user and made ample use of Gestalt's Principles so that the infomation is communicated in a natural way.
There are prompts in the story which highlights where interactivity can be used to view changes in certain metrics.
